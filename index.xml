      <description>About Liberty for Hong Kong Liberty for Hong Kong, or L4HK is a non-profit and collaborative project to crowdsource and document Hong Kong&amp;rsquo;s journey to achieving meaningful freedom, democracy, and autonomy. This project was first created in the wake of the 2019 Anti-Extradition Bill protests. Check us out on GitHub.
L4HK is not supported or funded by any organisation.
