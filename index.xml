      <description>About Liberty for Hong Kong Liberty for Hong Kong, or L4HK is a non-profit and collaborative project to crowdsource and document Hong Kong&amp;rsquo;s journey to achieving meaningful freedom, democracy, and autonomy. This project was first created in the wake of the 2019 Anti-Extradition Bill protests. Check us out on GitHub.
L4HK is not supported or funded by any organisation.
Introduction The 2019 protests against the controversial extradition bill in Hong Kong unearthed a network of underlying factors and forces which threaten to erode the civil liberties of its citizens.</description>

      <title>Declaration of Hong Kong Protestors / 香港人抗爭宣言</title>

      <description>Dear Hongkongers,
We are protesters from the civic society. If there’s a choice, we wish we didn’t have to protest against tyranny with our own bodies, and didn’t have to occupy the Hong Kong Legislative Council as a bargaining chip in negotiations with the Government. But the Government has put aside all principles and procedures, ignored the demands of Hong Kong People, and repeated their lame arguments and lied over and over again.</description>

Take Back Hong Kong, the Revolution of Our Time //光復香港，時代革命
The clarion call of the current wave of ongoing protests—also often translated as “liberate” or “reclaim”—this slogan traces its roots back to the election campaign of activist Edward Leung, currently serving a six-year prison sentence for rioting and assaulting a police officer during the so-called Fishball Revolution of 2016.</description>
